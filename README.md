# Feed Reader Testing

This is the sixth project in my pursuit of the Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing,
they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test
suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and
we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where
you come in. Testing is an important part of the development process. Writing
effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including
the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams
or joining a new company. Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze
whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without
having to manually test all of the functionality."
```
```

## Running the Application

To run this application on your local system, follow these steps:

- Download the project's ZIP file
- Extract the ZIP file
